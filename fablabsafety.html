<h3>Tools Assignment<br /> </h3>
For this assignment, Ive created a simple and portable smartphone stand from cardboard. I took the measurements from a Youtube video which you can can watch if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLlQsozgF4o"> Click here.</a> I only had to use my pen knife for this. It actually turned out great and it nicely fits in my pocket. This would be great as a gift to my friends.</br>
